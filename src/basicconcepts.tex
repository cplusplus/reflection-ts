\pnum

\begin{std.txt}
\added{
A function or variable of static storage duration reflected by \tcode{T} (\ref{dcl.type.reflexpr}) is
odr-used by the specialization
\tcode{std::experimental::reflect::get\char`_pointer<T>} (\ref{reflect.ops.value},
\ref{reflect.ops.fct}), as
if by taking the address of an \grammarterm{id-expression} nominating the
function or variable.
}

\pnum
In C++ [basic.def.odr], apply the following changes to the second bullet within paragraph \cxxref{basic.def.odr.odrparagraph2}:

\begin{std.txt}
and the object has the same value in all definitions of D\added{, or a type
implementing\\ \tcode{std::experimental::reflect::Object} (\ref{reflect.concepts.object}), as long as all operations (\ref{reflect.ops}) on this type yield the same constant expression results}; and

An expression of type \tcode{void} shall be used only as an expression
statement (\cxxref{stmt.expr}), as an operand of a comma expression
(\cxxref{expr.comma}), as a second or
third operand of \tcode{?:} (\cxxref{expr.cond}), as the operand of \tcode{typeid},
\tcode{noexcept}, \added{\tcode{reflexpr},} or \tcode{decltype}, as the
expression in a \tcode{return} statement (\cxxref{stmt.return}) for a function with the return type
\tcode{void}, or as the operand of an explicit conversion to type
\emph{cv} \tcode{void}.
